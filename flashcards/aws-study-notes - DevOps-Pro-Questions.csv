"Describe the differences between the following deployment strategies:
- Single Target
- All-at-Once
- Minimum in-service
- Rolling Deployment
- Blue Green
- Canary","- Single target deploys to one target with downtime during installation
- All-at-once is just like single but with multiple targets
- Min. in service means you define X, the lowest number of targets that should be available during installations
- Rolling would mean that you define X, the number of targets that should be updated at a time
- Blue Green spins up an entire copy of the targets for you to test and approve before switching traffic
- Canary lets you route traffic as weighted percentages and slowly increase the proportion going to the new installation",SDLC Automation
