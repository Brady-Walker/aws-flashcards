"If Multi-AZ is enabled on your database and you create a read replica, from which AZ will it take a snapshot?",It normally would use the primary DB and cause some downtime. If Multi AZ is enabled though it will take a snapshot of the secondary DB.,High Availability & Business Continuity
In what situation would you want to promote a read replica to its own standalone DB?,A good example is an ecommerce site that wants to open up a shop in a new region.

Scale reads to users in a region closer to them
Make it easer to migrate data centers from region to region",High Availability & Business Continuity

Which two DBs don't support read replicas in different regions?,SQL Server and Oracle,High Availability & Business Continuity
Is read replica replication synchronous or asynchronous?,Async only,High Availability & Business Continuity
Can you have read replicas of read replicas?,Yes (probably only for MySQL) and it will further increase latency,High Availability & Business Continuity
Can DB snapshots and automated backups be taken from read replicas?,NO,High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: Read replicas can be created from multi-AZ DBs but cannot be multi-AZ themselves.,TRUE,High Availability & Business Continuity
Is Multi-AZ replication synchronous or asynchronous?,Synchronous,High Availability & Business Continuity
"If your app doesn't require transaction support, ACID compliance, joins, or SQL, what should you use instead of RDS?",DynamoDB,High Availability & Business Continuity
Archive retrieval from Glacier takes how long?,3 or more hours,High Availability & Business Continuity
What are the four types of Storage Gateways and what file storage protocol do they use?,"1. File Interface (NFS)
2. Volume Interface (iSCSI based block storage)
    - Gateway-Cached Volumes
    - Gateway-Stored Volumes
3. Tape Interface (iSCSI based virtual tape solution)
    - Gateway-Virtual Tape Library",High Availability & Business Continuity
Describe the use of File Gateway.,Basically treats S3 as an NFS / SMB mount point,High Availability & Business Continuity
Describe the two types of Gateway Volumes and their uses.,"Cached - Cache your most used files on site
Stored - 1 to 1 copy of everything on site that is backed up on to S3",High Availability & Business Continuity
Describe the use of Gateway-Virtual Tape Library.,Virtual tape backups for cheap storage on glacier,High Availability & Business Continuity
What are the maximums for the four storage gateways.,"File Gateway - Unlimited storage. Max file size is 5TB.
Gateway-Cached Volumes - Each volume 32TB. Max 32 Volumes with 1PB of data (32 x 32)
Gateway-Stored Volumes - Each volume 16TB. Max 32 Volumes with 512TB of data (32 x 16)
Gateway-Virtual Tape Library:
    - Virtual Tape Library (S3) 1500 virtual tapes (1PB)
    - Virtual Tape Shelf (Glacier) unlimited",High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: Storage Gateway can be deployed on premise or as an EC2 instance,TRUE,High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: Storage Gateway cannot schedule snapshots,FALSE,High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: You can use Storage Gateway with Direct Connect,TRUE,High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: Storage Gateway cannot implement bandwidth throttling,FALSE,High Availability & Business Continuity
"If using storage gateway on premise, what two types of hypervisors can you choose from?",Vmware's ESXi or Hyper-V,High Availability & Business Continuity
What ports needs opened on your firewalls when using Storage Gateway?,"port 443
port 80 (activation only)
port 3260 (internal iSCSI connections)
port UDP 53 (DNS)",High Availability & Business Continuity
"True or False: With Storage Gateway, data in transit is secured using SSL and at rest using AES-256",TRUE,High Availability & Business Continuity
Gateway stored volumes are stored as EBS snapshots in what service?,S3,High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: You can use a storage gateway snapshot to create a new Gateway-Stored volume or to create a new EBS volume,TRUE,High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: Gateway-Cached snapshots can be used to version your data and rollback when needed,TRUE,High Availability & Business Continuity
What is the difference in retrieval times for the Virtual Tape Library (S3) vs the Virtual Tape Shelf (Glacier),Instantaneous & 24 hours respectively,High Availability & Business Continuity
Do you need a storage gateway in each site if using multiple locations?,Yes,High Availability & Business Continuity
Describe Snowball and the historical service that it mostly replaced.,Snowball can import to S3 or export from S3. Its a physical device that you would use to transfer data to or from AWS. It has mostly replaced Import/Export.,High Availability & Business Continuity
List the export/import destinations for Import/Export/Snowball,"Exports S3 ONLY! Glacier export requires an export to S3 first.
Import data into S3, EBS, and Glacier",High Availability & Business Continuity
"When using Import/Export to export from an S3 bucket with versioning, will all versions be exported? ",NO. Only the most recent versions,
Which 3 services have automated backups by default?,"- RDS
- Elasticache (Redis Only)
- Redshift",High Availability & Business Continuity
How do you enable automated backups on EC2? What should you watch out for?,"There are no automated backups unless you right your own script.
Backups will degrade performance
Stored in S3
Backups are incremental",High Availability & Business Continuity
What must you enable for MySQL to have automated backups?,InnoDB,High Availability & Business Continuity
True or False: There is a performance hit on RDS when doing automated backups while multi AZ is enabled.,False. Having multi AZ enabled prevents the performance hit,High Availability & Business Continuity
"If you delete an RDS instance, are all automated and manual backups/snapshots deleted?","Automated snapshots are deleted.
Manual snapshots are not.",High Availability & Business Continuity
Where are RDS snapshots stored?,S3,High Availability & Business Continuity
"When you restore a DB on RDS, can you change the engine type?",Yes. For example you can upgrade from SQL standard to SQL enterprise provided you have enough storage.,High Availability & Business Continuity
"When backing up Elasticache (only available on Redis), how much of the cluster is snapshotted, will it affect performance, and where is the snapshot stored?","The entire cluster is snapshotted
