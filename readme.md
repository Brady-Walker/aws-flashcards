# CSV Flashcards

This is my collection of notes while studying for the AWS Solutions Architect associate exam (2018). Any flashcards can be used if they follow the csv format in the examples included.

Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run with `python3 flashcards.py`

I will be adding more notes as I study

Activating after creating: `source path/to/env-directory/activate`
