They cannot be stopped and if the host fails, the underlying data will be lost. EBS can be stopped while persisting the data.
Both can be rebooted without losing data.
If used as ROOT volumes, by default, either type will be deleted on termination of the instance, however EBS volumes will have an option to keep the root device volume.",EC2

"Upon creation, do Elastic Load Balancers have a pre-defined IPv4 address?",No. You resolve to them using a DNS name,Route53
"Concerning Elastic Load Balancers, what is the difference between an Alias recod and a CNAME?","- Alias records allow you to resolve a naked domain name to an Elastic Load Balancer's DNS.
- When resolving, you will be charged for using a CNAME but will not for using an Alias

"In RDS, what is the difference between Multi-AZ and read replicas?","Multi-AZ: Your RDS instance is synchronously replicated to a copy in a different availability zone (us-east-1 and us-east-2) and if one goes down, the other will automagically take over
Read Replica: If you're doing enough reads from your DB to bottleneck your application you can create replicas to read from and writing will propogate back to the original",AWS Databases
Describe Aurora's strategy for availability and scaling,"- 2 copies of your data are contained in each AZ, with a minimum of 3 AZ's, meaning 6 copies of your data
- Aurora write availability: Is designed to work while losing up to two copies of data

What are the two types of Redshift configurations?,"Single Node: Small-Medium business with 160GB of storage
Multi-Node:
 - Leader Node (manage client connections and receives queries)
 - Compute Node (Store data and perform queries) (Max. 128 compute nodes)",AWS Databases
In what situations would you use Elasticache over Read Replicas?,"Elasticache would be more useful for DB queries that are being called repeatedly.
Read replicas would be more useful for DB's that are being queried many times but not necessarily with the same queries",AWS Databases

Max value: 12 hours",Application Services
"In SQS, what is the difference between short and long polling?","In short polling, SQS will return a response immediately even if the queue is empty. In long polling, SQS will return a response only when there is a message for the receiver or the long poll times out.",Application Services
In SQS what queue ordering options are there and which is the default?,"Standard is the default and is kinda ordered by time entering the queue.
FIFO (first in first out) is strictly ordered.",Application Services
What are some differences between SWF and SQS?,"- SQS has a retention period up to 14 days while SWF can retain up to 1 year.
- SWF presents task-oriented API where SQS is message-oriented.

What is the purpose of the Xen Hypervisor and AWS Firewall and what is their relationship?,The Xen hypervisor isolates different instances running on the same physical machine. The firewall resides within the hypervisor layer between the physical network interface and the virtual interface.,Security
Do AWS customers have access to raw disk devices on their instance? Also what happens to memory after a customer is done using it?,No they are virtualized disks. All memory is scrubbed (set to zero) by the hypervisor when it becomes unallocated to a guest.,Security
How does the AWS Guest Operating System work?,"Virtual instances are completely controlled by the customer who have full root access over accounts, applications, and services.
AWS does not have any access rights to your instances or the guest OS.",Security
How does the AWS Firewall behave by default?,EC2 provides a complete firewall solution. This mandatory inbound firewall is configured in a default deny-all mode and you must explicity open the ports needed to allow inbound traffic.,Security
"What type of encryption does AWS offer for their EBS volumes and what restriction do they place in order to ensure efficient, low-latency encryption?","AES-256. Its only available on EC2's more powerful instance types (e.g. M3, C3, R3, G2)",Security
"For Elastic Load Balancer, what is SSL termination?","Previously, each EC2 instance had to handle the SSL termination and have a certificate installed.

"How often does AWS management re-evaluate the strategic business plan, including risk identification?",At least biannually,Security
Does AWS Security regularly scan their own internet facing service endpoints for vulnerabilities or is this handled by independent security firms?,Both!,Security
Can customers request permission to conduct scans of their cloud infrastructure?,Yes as long as they are limited to the customer's instances and do not violate the AWS Acceptable Use Policy,Security
What are the two main use cases for Storage Gateway?,"Gateway-Cached volumes allows you to utilize S3 as your primary data store while keeping a portion of your data cached locally (at your business) for frequently accessed data. 
Gateway-Stored volumes stores all of your data locally but asynchronously backs up all data to S3",AWS
What does it mean to design for failure?,"When designing architectures in the cloud, assume things will fail.
Assume hardware will fail
Assume outages will occur
Assume some disaster will strike your application
Assume you will be slammed with requests some day
Think about recovery strategy during design which will create a more robust overall system.",AWS
What does it mean to Decouple your Components when architecting?,"Build components that do not have tight dependencies so that if one component were to die, sleep, or remain busy, the other components are built so as to continue to work as if no failure is happening.",AWS
What are the three ways to implement elasticity in AWS architecture?,"1. Proactive Cyclic Scaling - Periodic scaling that occurs at fixed intervals (e.g. pay days, weekends)
