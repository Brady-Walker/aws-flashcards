(Snowball edge & Snowmobile),S3
How do you use S3 transfer acceleration and how does it work?,"Instead of uploading directly to an S3 bucket, transfer acceleration provides a distinct URL (with the word accelerate in it) that will upload the file to S3 and utilise CloudFront for distribution.",S3

"What is the difference between On Demand, Reserved, Spot, and Dedicated Hosts instances?","On Demand - Pay a fixed rate by the hour or second with no commitment
Reserved - Provide you with a capacity reservation (with a significant discount) usually for 1 or 3 year terms
Spot - Allows you to bid a price for instance capacity, providing greater saving if you have flexible start/end times
Dedicated Hosts - Physically separate EC2 servers for dedicated use. Good for server-bound software licenses.",EC2

HDD, Cold - SC1 - less frequently accessed data (file server)
HDD, Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed data (is bootable)",EC2
Can you mount 1 EBS Volume to multiple EC2 instances?,"No, you should use EFS",EC2
Is termination protection on by default?,"No, you must turn it on",EC2
"By default on an EBS backed instance, what will happen to the root EBS volume when the instance is terminated?",The root EBS volume will be deleted,EC2
Can Root Volumes be encrypted by default? What about additional volumes?,"No, you need a third party tool to encrypt the root volume. Additonal volumes can be encrypted by default.",EC2
What is a volume in reference to EBS?,Basically a virtual Hard Disk,EC2
What is a snapshot and where is it stored?,Snapshots are point-in-time copies of Volumes that are stored in S3,EC2
How are snapshots stored on S3?,"Snapshots are saved incrementally, so the first may take a while but additional snapshots only update blocks that have been changed since the last snapshot",EC2
Are snapshots of encrypted volumes encrypted automatically?,Yes and restoring the snapshot will create an encrypted volume,EC2
What criteria determines if you can share a volume?,You can only share if the volume is not encrypted. You may then share to other AWS accounts or make the volume public.,EC2
Do you need to stop an instance if you are trying to create a snapshot of that instance's root EBS volume?,Yes,EC2
Describe the differences between EBS and Instance Store volumes (What happens upon termination of an instance? On reboot?),"Instance stores are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage. They cannot be stopped and if the host fails, the underlying data will be lost. EBS can be stopped while persisting the data.
Both can be rebooted without losing data.
If used as ROOT volumes, by default, either type will be deleted on termination of the instance, however EBS volumes will have an option to keep the root device volume.",EC2

2. Flush all caches to the disk

2a. Freeze the file system
2b. Unmount the RAID Array
2c. Shut down the associated EC2 Instance (easiest option)",EC2

"Concerning Elastic Load Balancers, what is the difference between an Alias recod and a CNAME?","- Alias records allow you to resolve a naked domain name to an Elastic Load Balancer's DNS.
- When resolving, you will be charged for using a CNAME but will not for using an Alias
- Given the choice, always use an Alias record",Route53
"Describe the differences between the following routing policies:
- Simple
- Weighted
- Latency
- Failover
- Geolocation","- Simple: stupid round robin (take turns)
- Weighted: Percentage based (10% here 90% there)

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- Aurora
- MariaDB",AWS Databases
What is the difference between Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytics Processing (OLAP) and what service fits each type of query?,"- OLTP would use RDS and very transactional queries (give me the name, date, and address for this shipment)
- OLAP would use Redshift and the query would involve much more data processing (give me the net profit for a specific product sold in multiple regions)",AWS Databases
What is the name of Amazon's No SQL database?,DynamoDB,AWS Databases
What two caching systems/databases are available in AWS Elasticache?,"- Memcached
- Redis",AWS Databases
"In RDS, what is the difference between Multi-AZ and read replicas?","Multi-AZ: Your RDS instance is synchronously replicated to a copy in a different availability zone (us-east-1 and us-east-2) and if one goes down, the other will automagically take over
Read Replica: If you're doing enough reads from your DB to bottleneck your application you can create replicas to read from and writing will propogate back to the original",AWS Databases
Describe Aurora's strategy for availability and scaling,"- 2 copies of your data are contained in each AZ, with a minimum of 3 AZ's, meaning 6 copies of your data
- Aurora write availability: Is designed to work while losing up to two copies of data
- Aurora read availability: Is designed to work while losing up to three copies of data
- Aurora storage is self healing: data blocks and diskas are continuously scanned for errors and repaired automatically",AWS Databases
What are the two types of Aurora replicas available and their maximum quantity?,"Aurora Replicas: max 15
MySQL Read Replicas: max 5",AWS Databases
What is the major difference between scaling RDS and DynamoDB?,"DynamoDB offers ""push button"" scaling without any downtime.
RDS would need a bigger instance size or to have read replicas added (would need a maintenance window)",AWS Databases
DynamoDB uses what type of storage spread across how many data centres?,Stored on SSD across 3 geographically distinct data centers,AWS Databases
"In DynamoDB, what is the difference between Eventual Consistent Reads and Strongly Consistent Reads?","Eventual Consistent Reads is the default setting.
If you need to be able to read changes to the data within one second of writing, you need Strongly Consistent Reads.",AWS Databases
What are the two types of Redshift configurations?,"Single Node: Small-Medium business with 160GB of storage
Multi-Node:
 - Leader Node (manage client connections and receives queries)
 - Compute Node (Store data and perform queries) (Max. 128 compute nodes)",AWS Databases
In what situations would you use Elasticache over Read Replicas?,"Elasticache would be more useful for DB queries that are being called repeatedly.
Read replicas would be more useful for DB's that are being queried many times but not necessarily with the same queries",AWS Databases
