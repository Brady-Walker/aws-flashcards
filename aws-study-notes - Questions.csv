(Snowball edge & Snowmobile),S3
How do you use S3 transfer acceleration and how does it work?,"Instead of uploading directly to an S3 bucket, transfer acceleration provides a distinct URL (with the word accelerate in it) that will upload the file to S3 and utilise CloudFront for distribution.",S3

What is a snapshot and where is it stored?,Snapshots are point-in-time copies of Volumes that are stored in S3,EC2
How are snapshots stored on S3?,"Snapshots are saved incrementally, so the first may take a while but additional snapshots only update blocks that have been changed since the last snapshot",EC2
Are snapshots of encrypted volumes encrypted automatically?,Yes and restoring the snapshot will create an encrypted volume,EC2
What criteria determines if you can share a volume?,You can only share if the volume is not encrypted. You may then share to other AWS accounts or make the volume public.,EC2

Describe the differences between EBS and Instance Store volumes (What happens upon termination of an instance? On reboot?),"Instance stores are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage. They cannot be stopped and if the host fails, the underlying data will be lost. EBS can be stopped while persisting the data.
Both can be rebooted without losing data.
If used as ROOT volumes, by default, either type will be deleted on termination of the instance, however EBS volumes will have an option to keep the root device volume.",EC2
